	abstract = {The scaled agile framework (SAFe) is a set of organization and workflow patterns intended to guide enterprises in scaling lean and agile practices. Along with disciplined agile delivery (DAD) and S@S (Scrum@Scale), SAFe is one of a growing number of frameworks that seek to address the problems encountered when scaling beyond a single team. 
SAFe promotes alignment, collaboration, and delivery across large numbers of agile teams. It was developed by and for practitioners, by leveraging three primary bodies of knowledge: agile software development, lean product development, and systems thinking.
The primary reference for the scaled agile framework was originally the development of a big picture view of how work flowed from product management (or other stakeholders), through governance, program, and development teams, out to customers. With the collaboration of others in the agile community, this was progressively refined and then first formally described in a 2007 book. The framework continues to be developed and shared publicly; with an academy and an accreditation scheme supporting those who seek to implement, support, or train others in the adoption of SAFe.
Starting at its first release in 2011, six major versions have been released while the latest edition, version 6.0, was released in March 2023.
While SAFe continues to be recognised as the most common approach to scaling agile practices (at 30 percent and growing),, it also has received criticism for being too hierarchical and inflexible. It also receives criticism for giving organizations the illusion of adopting Agile, while keeping familiar processes intact.},

	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Little%27s_law&oldid=1315807023},
	abstract = {In mathematical queueing theory, Little's law (also result, theorem, lemma, or formula) is a theorem by John Little which states that the long-term average number of customers (L) in a stationary system is equal to the long-term average effective arrival rate (λ) multiplied by the average time that a customer spends in the system (W). Expressed algebraically the law is

  
    
      
        L
        =
        λ
        W
        .
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle L={\textbackslash}lambda W.\}
  

The relationship is not influenced by the arrival process distribution, the service distribution, the service order, or practically anything else. In most queuing systems, service time is the bottleneck that creates the queue.
The result applies to any system, and particularly, it applies to systems within systems. For example in a bank branch, the customer line might be one subsystem, and each of the tellers another subsystem, and Little's result could be applied to each one, as well as the whole thing. The only requirement is that the system be ergodic.
In some cases it is possible not only to mathematically relate  the average number in the system to the average wait but even to relate the entire probability distribution (and moments) of the number in the system to the wait.},

Cynefin offers five decision-making contexts or "domains"—clear (also known as simple or obvious), complicated, complex, chaotic, and confusion (or disorder)—that help managers to identify how they perceive situations and make sense of their own and other people's behaviour.

Extreme and Agile methods are closely associated with Test-Driven Development (TDD), of which Beck is perhaps the leading proponent.
Beck pioneered software design patterns, as well as the commercial application of Smalltalk. He wrote the SUnit unit testing framework for Smalltalk, which spawned the xUnit series of frameworks, notably JUnit for Java, which Beck wrote with Erich Gamma. Beck popularized CRC cards with Ward Cunningham, the inventor of the wiki.
He lives in San Francisco, California and previously worked at Facebook. In 2019, Beck joined Gusto as a software fellow and coach, where he coaches engineering teams as they build out payroll systems for small businesses.},
